Hello!

This website's URL is: http://iequiz.byethost10.com/welcome.html

It takes your name at the welcome page. Then you answer all the questions (over 3 pages) and click End Test. 

Your name you entered at the start and your score gets submitted to a spreadsheet. 
I commented how to do that in quizSubmitted.html in the <script> section. 

I used ByetHost to host my free domain (https://byet.host/index.php/free-hosting).
And used FileZilla to transfer files to the server.
